# 🚨 Phishing Website Detection by Machine Learning Techniques

> **Creative, practical, and ready-to-run** README for the `Phishing-Website-Detection-by-Machine-Learning-Techniques` project.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
Phishing attacks are a major threat to online security — attackers impersonate trusted websites to steal credentials and sensitive data. This project explores **feature-based machine learning** approaches to detect phishing websites before users fall prey.

It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, multiple ML models, model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC), and a small web demo to test live URLs or batch CSVs.

---

## ✨ Highlights
- Multiple ML algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost (optional), Gradient Boosting, SVM.
- Feature extraction from URL, HTML, and domain metadata (e.g., URL length, presence of `@`, number of subdomains, SSL certificate checks, suspicious keywords, Alexa ranking if available).
- Clean, modular scripts: `train.py`, `evaluate.py`, `predict.py`, and a lightweight web demo (`app.py`) using Streamlit / Flask.
- Reproducible pipeline with `requirements.txt` and optional Dockerfile.

## 🧰 Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Key libraries (install with `pip`):
  - `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`, `xgboost` (optional), `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (for EDA), `tqdm`, `requests`, `beautifulsoup4` (if extracting HTML features), `streamlit` or `flask` for demo.

**Install:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## 🧩 Dataset

You can use any labeled phishing dataset (CSV with `url` + `label` columns). Common choices:

* UCI Phishing Websites Dataset (or similar public datasets)
* Custom dataset collected via crawlers or public threat feeds

Place original CSVs in `data/raw/` and processed outputs in `data/processed/`.

---

## ⚙️ Quickstart — Train a model

1. Preprocess & extract features (example):

```bash
python src/train.py --data data/raw/phishing.csv --out data/processed/features.csv --model rf
```

2. Train and save the model (inside `train.py` you'll find options for cross-validation and hyperparameters):

```bash
python src/train.py --features data/processed/features.csv --save models/rf_model.joblib --model random_forest
```

> `train.py` should support flags for model choice, CV folds, random seed, and hyperparams.

---

## 🧪 Predict / Evaluate

* Evaluate on a holdout CSV:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model models/rf_model.joblib --test data/processed/test_features.csv --metrics out/metrics.json
```

* Predict a single URL:

```bash
python src/predict.py --model models/rf_model.joblib --url "http://example.com/login"
```

`predict.py` should output probability of phishing and top contributing features (if using tree-based models, return feature importances or SHAP values for explainability).

---

## 📈 Recommended Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision / Recall
* F1-score (important when classes are imbalanced)
* ROC AUC
* Confusion matrix (visual)

Use cross-validation and report mean ± std for robust results.

---

## 🔧 Feature Ideas (start here)

* URL-based: length, presence of `@`, `-`, number of `//`, number of digits, URL entropy
* Domain-based: age of domain (WHOIS), number of subdomains, suspicious TLDs
* HTML-based: presence of suspicious scripts, forms, inline iframes
* SSL: is HTTPS used, certificate mismatches
* External signals: Alexa rank, blacklists (if available)

Tip: Keep feature extraction fast — many production flows rely purely on URL text features for speed.

---

## 🧠 Model Suggestions & Tips

* Start with Logistic Regression and Random Forest for baseline.
* Use class-weight balancing or oversampling (SMOTE) when classes are imbalanced.
* Tree models + SHAP for explainability works well in security contexts.
* Calibrate probabilities (Platt scaling / isotonic) if you need reliable risk scores.

---

## 🧩 Production / Demo

Use `app.py` to expose a simple demo:

* Streamlit: quick interactive UI for pasting URLs and showing prediction + feature highlights.
* Flask: create a REST API endpoint `/predict` that returns `{url, phishing_prob, label}` and can be deployed behind a lightweight server.

Add a Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` if you want a reproducible demo environment.

## 🚨 Ethical & Legal

* Do not use this project for illegal activities. Data collection from third-party sites should respect robots.txt and terms of service.
* Be careful with WHOIS and external lookups (rate limits, privacy concerns).

---

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs welcome! Good first issues:

* Add more robust URL features
* Add unit tests for `features.py`
* Add CI configuration (GitHub Actions) for linting and tests
